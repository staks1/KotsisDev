    <h1>Uploading files with FastAPI
    </h1>

    <p>
      In the previous <a href = "./fast-api-app.html">[post]</a>
      we developed a simple Document Intelligence App that 
      takes the paths of pdf files, processes them using a Class 
      that encapsulates our "Document Intelligence" pipeline 
      and finally saves a final <strong>csv</strong> file 
      with the extracted table, while also returning the serialized 
      Document model (along with the processed pages) back to the client.
      This is great but who would actually use such an app locally ?
      To be able to make this an actual application we need to be 
      able to upload files that the pipeline can then process.
      Today we are going to use the Upload options from FastAPI.

    </p>


    <h2>[models.py]</h2>
    <p> OK now for the hard part... But wait, there is no hard part!
        FastAPI offers the class  <mark>File</mark> so that 
        we can define files to be uploaded. To start with in 
        the original documentation <a href = "https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/request-files/">[link]</a> 
        we are instructed to first download 
        <mark>python-multipart</mark> so we can receive uploaded files.
        Uploaded files are sent like form-data and to upload forms ,
        this library is required. 
    </p>
    <p>The first thing to remember is we need to go the path operation function 
        that will actually upload the file (it is a post method) and define a class 
        <mark>File</mark> for the input we want to upload. This is required 
        because of forgotten FastAPI will intepret the inputs as query parameters or 
        a json body. 
        Then we can simply type hint the input with <mark>bytes</mark>
        and that means that FastAPI will read the file and we will receive the contents 
        as bytes. But be careful <u>the whole contents will be stored in memory</u>.
        This is great for small files but for our case, since we do not 
        know how large the pdf files might be we could probably benefit from 
        trying out other options. And one such option is to use the 
        <mark>Upload</mark> class! This will automatically store part of the file in memory 
        up to a certain limit and then what remains will be stored in disk,
        which is great for larger files.
        It also exposes certain attributes like for example 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>filename</strong>: the original filename </li>
            <li><strong>content_type</strong>: string with the content type </li>
            <li><strong>file</strong>: this is the actual file object we can use like ordinary files in python</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
        <p>
        The last point is really important. 
        This means we can use this file object with file methods like read or write.
        The documentation informs us about this here <a href = "https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/request-files/#file-parameters-with-uploadfile">[Link]</a>
        once again making life better! It says the methods we can call on the file 
        are async so we need to await them. 
        On the other hand if the need to read the file synchronously 
        appears we can call the method on the <code>pdf_file.file</code>
        and process them in sync methods, so schedule them in different threads.
        </p>
        <p> Using the async methods allows to combine reading the file 
            with <code>aiofiles</code> so we can read a file in chunks
            and asynchronously! And that's all we are going to need. 
            Now we need to go to our class method
            <code>parsePdf</code>
            and just change the input from the Pydantic model we had created 
            to <code>File(...)</code> and FastAPI will expect a file upload there.

        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
    async def parsePdf(self, pdf_input: UploadFile = File(...)) -> dict[int, str]:
        print("parsing pdf")
        # print(pdf_input.pdf_path)
        extracted_text: dict[int, str] = {}

        # now read the pdf file asynchronously and write it to temp location
        # disk + ram , then we need to process it
        # and upload it write in predefined location --> ./filename
        try:
            async with aiofiles.open(pdf_input.filename, "wb") as f:
                print(f"the whole file has size {pdf_input.size}")
                contents = await pdf_input.read(4096)
                read_bytes = 0
                while contents:
                    # this should be customizable, the size
                    await f.write(contents)
                    read_bytes += 4096
                    contents = await pdf_input.read(4096)
                print(f"total bytes read {read_bytes}\n")
        except Exception:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Problem uploading file")
        # we assume file read is done and ok now
        reader = PdfReader(pdf_input.filename)
        self.number_of_pages = len(reader.pages)
        print(f"This pdf has {self.number_of_pages} pages.")
        extracted_text = {i: x.extract_text() for i, x in enumerate(reader.pages)}

        # here call the classifier
        print("extracted text is", extracted_text)

        # initialize classifier and use it
        doc_classifier = Templateclassifier()
        all_pdf_text = "".join(
            [f"\npage{i}\n" + x.extract_text() for i, x in enumerate(reader.pages)]
        )
        category = doc_classifier.doc_classify(all_pdf_text)
        print("category is", category)

        return extracted_text
    </code> </pre>
    <p>
    As you can see here we asynchronously read the file 
    in chunks of <code>4096</code> bytes using the <code>read</code>
    method on the original input file and write it temporarily. This is done in the 
    method that is used as the starting point of our pipeline. 
    If your use case is to only read the file then awaiting for 
    file read should be enough. Also it is great that other requests 
    can also be run to the server while reading is happening.
    Of course we could potentially use a separate path operation 
    function, upload the file, save it and then call our pipeline
    based on some certain <strong>file name</strong> or 
    <strong>file id</strong>. 
    This pipeline here assumes fast direct processing of the latest uploaded file
    meaning we are in a hurry to extract those tables!
    The line <code>contents = await pdf_input.read(4096)</code> 
    uses 4096 bytes to read each time and write it to a file, but this can be customized. 
    A simple method could be created to check size of the file 
    and decide what size of chunk we are going to read in memory at one time.
    Also note here because i use the <mark>PdfReader</mark> i save the 
    file temporarily to process it easily by path.
    </p>
    <p>
    And the final cherry on top is that we don't really need to do 
    anything else in our Class besides changing the call_pdf_pipeline function 
    so that it now takes as input the same type that <code>parsePdf</code>
    expects and FastAPI will validate the whole pipeline correctly.
    Now this is awesome!
</p>
    <pre><code class = 'language-python'>
    async def call_pdf_pipeline(self, pdf_input: UploadFile) -> PDFmodeloutput:
        ...
    </code>
</pre>
<h2>[Testing the method]</h2>
Visiting the endpoint and uploading a file we can see 
that when we click execute button

And there it is! We get the same response as before. Our pdf processed 
and the csv saved.
