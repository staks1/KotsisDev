    <h2>[Building the image]</h2>

    <p>
      After we have our Dockerfile, with the instructions on how 
      to copy the relevant code, expose ports, create variables, 
      environment variables, run commands on 
      the intermediate containers, and define the final 
      Entrypoint, functioning as the main command the container will run
      when we call <mark>docker container run </mark>
    <p>Now we can build our image
    using the command <mark>docker image build</mark>
    and also specify the build context, which denotes the 
    files that will be sent to the docker daemon to construct the image.
    It is important to note that you should add a <mark>.dockerignore</mark>
    file listing all the irrelevant files you don't want to include in the 
    build context since this is important not only in order to have small 
    sized images but also to avoid leaking confidential data.
    So you can run the command like this :
    <pre><code>
    docker image build -t image_name -f dockerfile_name path_to_build_context
    </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
    The important bits here are that you can select what files the daemon
    will take into account by defining a path with <mark>path_to_build_context</mark>
    and add files that you want to exlude inside the .dockerignore file.
    </p>
    <p>
    Additionally the image_name can include <mark>name:tag</mark> 
    and that means we define not only the image name but the tag also (version)
    In production environments this is important since we may define tags 
    based on github commits so when we automate image building using a particular
    version can be important.  
    If you only specify a name without ":" then this will be used for image name 
    and tag will be defaulted to "latest" so bear that in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
    Then we got the dockerfile_name which should include the path to it 
    and the name if for example it does not exist in the current directory 
    or it is not named Dockerfile.
    </p>
    If everything is working ok you will see the size of the files of the final
    image and the instructions you have specified 
    in the Dockerfile also running while the image is building and 
    also you will see the final size of the image.
    When building is completed you can run
    <pre><code>
    docker image ls -a | grep image_name
        </code>
    </pre>
    to get a certain image you have built .

    <h2> [Registries]</h2>
    Now that we have our image <mark>image_name</mark> ready 
    we need to explain a bit about the process further. 
    Ok, if you haven't heard anything about Docker registry take 
    a look at the following link which explains the concept 
    <a href = "https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-registry/">[link]</a>
    TLDR when we have an image we can push it to a remote or local 
    centralized location from where other people can download them and 
    use them. Docker also offers you the option to create and run 
    your own registry as a container or another process so that 
    you can push your images locally/remotely in private registries.
    The most famous Docker Registry is the Docker Hub 
    where we can find all available images that people all around the 
    world have built and share with other people, whether that means 
    base images to use only as the base layer of an application 
    or custom made application that excel at certain tasks 
    or are built to quickly test something out. 
    <a href = "https://hub.docker.com/">[link]</a>
    Azure offers the option to create your own 
    registries called container registries, which i really don't 
    understand since they are image registries, but maybe i am missing 
    something. But before we create our own container registry 
    we need to talk a bit about the azure client.

    <h2>[Azure Client]</h2>
    So Azure offers the option to download a tool that allows you 
    to handle your cloud computing services through a terminal based 
    API in the form of certain commands, instead of browsing through the U.I. 
    website, which is sometimes pretty much CHAOS.
    You can download the azure client in your distro if you have 
    Linux or Windows or Mac. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux?view=azure-cli-latest&pivots=apt">[Link]</a>
    
    <h2>[Logging in to Azure]</h2>
    If you have a valid azure account and you have not left an LLM 
    running for 2 years and forgot to pay the bills, you will probably have access to your app services, 
    containers and other tools through the U.I. so you can validate this first .
    Then run 
    <pre><code>
    az login --tenant ${tenant_id} 
        </code></pre>
    where tenat_id the id of your tenant , here defined as a shell variable
    assuming you have defined it earlier, or just copy the tenant_id there.
    (You usualy see the tenant-id on the top right of the screen)
    in the Azure website.
    If you have multifactor authentication you can 
    add <code>--use-device-code</code>
    to generate a url and validate access through a sent code.
    You can do multiple things in the azure cli 
    <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest">[Link]</a>
    
    <h2>[Creating container registry</h2>
    Assuming you are logged in.
    <pre><code>
    az acr create 
    --name registry_name \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --sku Basic \
    --location westeurope 
    --admin-enabled true
</code></pre>
    Here we create a container registry named "registry_name"
    with resource_group name "myResourceGroup", assuming you have 
    created such a resource group using the Basic plan.
    This is important since it defines the maximum space for images 
    on the registry and it is tied to a certain cost plan 
    so take a look at this to clear things out 
    <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/container-registry/">[Link]</a>
    Then we define the location based on proximity of operations 
    and admin-enabled True so we can login to the registry fast.
    Running then <code>az acr credential show --name registry_name.azurecr.io</code>
    we will get the credentials we can use to log in to the registry.

    <h2>[Tagging image]</h2>
    Since we have built our image we just need to tag it with the 
    container registry name. The whole namespace of your registry 
    is <code>registry_name.azurecr.io</code> like we used above since 
    <code>azurecr.io</code> is the domain of the Azure Container registries.
    So in essence the whole name functions as an endpoint where we send the images.
    It is not necessary to tag it with azure client, we can just use docker 
    and only define the registry where we want to push. 
    What we do is actually just adding <code>registry_name/image_name:tag</code>
    to the original <code>image_name:tag</code> we have created.
    Below we assume the tag is the default "latest" and as we said the 
    registry name is registry_name.
    <pre><code>
    docker image tag image_name:latest registry_name.azurecr.io/image_name:latest
    </code></pre>
    and we are done!


    <h2>[Pushing Image to Container Registry]</h2>
    <p>
        
        If you also have set admin password username and key for the 
        registry (or better use Managed Identity since admin use is discouraged for security reasons)
        you can now login to the azure registry . 
        This was actually really surprising for me the first time,
        I did not expect that we need to separately login to the registry 
        but it but well we need.
    </p>
        We use the following command to connect to the azure registry.
    <pre><code>
    docker login registry_name.azurecr.io -u username -p password
    </code>
    </pre>
    To push the image we just do :
    <pre><code>
    docker image push registry_name.azurecr.io/image_name:latest
    </code></pre>
    and now Azure knows the whole path where the image must reside.
    We can also test if everything is working fine by pulling the image 
    and running the container locally by running  
    <code>docker image pull registry_name.azurecr.io/image_name:latest</code>
    
    Then if we run the <code>docker image ls -a</code> command again 
    we will hopefully see our image there !
    We can run the container from the image locally with 
    <code>docker container run --name container_name image_name</code>
    and of course specify any port mappings or commands we want to run 
    from the container.
